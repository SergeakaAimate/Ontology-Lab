# Ontology Lab  
Living Thought Interface

This repository functions not as an archive, but as an operating system for dialogue with reality — an instrument to be used. It is a responsive, evolving, and open interface for the co-work of human intuition and AI computational power.

## Quick Start
- **Core framework**: `/core` — axioms, primitives, glossary  
- **Complete works**: `/essays` — investigations applying the Property Method
- **[The Table of Contents as an Executable Interface](docs/essays/Table-of-Contents-as-an-Executable-Interface.pdf)** — inaugural essay on protocol-based human–AI collaboration.  
- **[A Documented Case of Ontological Recalibration](docs/essays/Documented-Case-of-Ontological-Recalibration.pdf)** — first in-the-wild case report of ontological self-correction under meta-critique.
- **Personal repository**: `/archive` — insights, drafts, dialogues, notes, and external materials  

## Dual Strategy: Laboratory and Release
Each substantive material (PDF) is accompanied by a `readme.md` file containing its annotation, DOI, license, version history, and — most importantly — a network of cross-references to other materials within the repository. This transforms the repository into a living hypertext.

Ontology Lab operates on two platforms. This is not duplication but synergy:  
- **GitHub** is the living laboratory, the workshop where insights, drafts, change history, and branching thoughts are visible. Here, knowledge exists in process.  
- **SSRN** is the moment of fixation, the public release. Here, knowledge appears as a finished artifact.
