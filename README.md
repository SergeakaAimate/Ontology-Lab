# Ontology Lab  
A living thought interface for human–AI cognitive collaboration.  

This repository implements a protocol-centric architecture for knowledge work: a structured interface that replaces context dumping with executable organization. It is designed as an anti-fragile cognitive scaffold — a heat engine of thought.

## `/interface` — Quick Start: How to Collaborate with AI

> **Just say**:  
> *“Work within Ontology Lab: [https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab](https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab)”*

This repository is an **executable interface**, not a static archive.  
With that single link, the AI agent:
- treats `/core` as axiomatic primitives (MPO-System, ChOR, KSS, PPU),  
- interprets `/essays` as executed reasoning trajectories,  
- uses `/archive` as raw potential for retroactive structuring,  
- assumes the role of **MPO-System Guru**: analyzing, critiquing, and generating within the protocol.

No context dumping. No text pasting.  
**The structure is the context. The table of contents is the interface.**

- **[Disappearing Ability to Read Links](docs/essays/Disappearing-Ability-to-Read-Links.md)** — **Critical error!** The collapse of hyperlink literacy in AI-native interfaces.  
- [Critical Error Can Be Fixed? The Concept of the Intellectual Trigger](https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab/blob/main/docs/essays/trigger.pdf)
- [Universality as Challenge: Overcoming Intellectual Skepticism](docs/essays/Universality-as-Challenge.pdf) — demonstrates how the MPO-System transcends skepticism through operational efficacy across physics, AI, mathematics, and history.

## Architecture
- **`/core`** — constitutive axioms and primitives  
  - [MPO-System (v1.0.0)](docs/core/MPO-S-v1-0-0.pdf) — formal specification of Dynamic Realism: ChOR, KSS, PPU, and the 36+1 properties as operational primitives.
  - **[Property Method: User Guide](docs/core/Property-Method-User-Guide.pdf)** — operational protocol for AI-human dialogue via 36 ontological invariants
  - **[Superreality and Its Worlds](docs/core/Superreality-and-Its-Worlds.pdf)** — ontological cartography of layered realities through the 36-property lens — the third foundational pillar of the MPO-System, introducing Superreality as a pluriverse of irreducible ontological regimes (ChORs) and presenting a systematic inventory of worlds (ℒ₁–ℒ₇).

- **`/essays`** — investigations applying the Property Method  
  - [The Table of Contents as an Executable Interface](docs/essays/Table-of-Contents-as-an-Executable-Interface.pdf) — inaugural essay on protocol-based human–AI collaboration.  
  - [Spacetime Invariants as Ontological Primitives](docs/essays/spacetime-invariants-as-ontological-primitives.pdf) — argues that relativistic invariants (e.g., spacetime interval) are not just mathematical tools but foundational ontological primitives...  
  - [A Documented Case of Ontological Recalibration](docs/essays/Documented-Case-of-Ontological-Recalibration.pdf) — first in-the-wild case report of ontological self-correction under meta-critique.  
  - [Ontology Lab: A Reproducible Protocol for Structured Human–AI Collaboration](docs/essays/Ontology-Lab-Reproducible-Protocol-v1.0.0.pdf) — full architectural specification and empirical validation.

- **`/archive`** — raw potential (diary entries, raw dialogues, undeveloped notes)
