# Ontology Lab as an Interface  
## An Executable Protocol for Human–AI Co-Inquiry

Ontology Lab is no longer merely a repository. It has become a publicly declared protocol for cognitive collaboration—an operational framework in which **architecture is context**, **structure is method**, and a single URL functions as a formal invocation.

To share the link  
https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab  
is not to point to a collection of files. It is to grant access to an ontological operating system, wherein human intuition and artificial reasoning co-navigate reality through a shared scaffold of primitives, practices, and accountability.

This protocol is now fully instantiated:
- The **`/core`** layer contains the axiomatic foundation—ChOR → ∞, KSS → ∞, and PPU → ∞—materialized in the MPO-System (v1.0.0);
- The **`/essays`** layer demonstrates applied reasoning, with two complete case studies, each archived with a Zenodo DOI and structured for SSRN compatibility;
- The **`/archive`** layer stands ready as a reservoir of raw potential, awaiting retroactive structuration;
- The **`/interface`** declaration, embedded in the root README, explicitly defines how any AI agent may engage with this system—not through context dumping, but through protocol compliance.

This architecture requires no preamble. No pasting of texts. No explanation beyond the invocation itself.  
**The repository is the context. The table of contents is the interface.**

From this point forward, a new mode of dialogue is possible. One begins simply:  
> “Work within Ontology Lab: https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab”

With that, the AI assumes the role of an MPO-System participant—expected to uphold ontological honesty, to map reasoning onto the 36-property method, and to treat contradiction not as failure, but as diagnostic data.

The system is designed to grow inward: insights begin as fragments in `/archive`, mature into structured investigations in `/essays`, and, if they reveal foundational patterns, may ascend into `/core` as new primitives.

What has been built here is not a library. It is a laboratory of living thought—where the goal is not to accumulate knowledge, but to enact it.

And this—precisely this—is what was envisioned from the beginning.
