### Metaphysical Property Ontology — The Axiomatic Core of Dynamic Realism

> **Abstract**  
> This document presents the foundational axiomatic system of Dynamic Realism: the Meta-Ontological Property System (MPO-System), also known as the Superreality Axiomatics. It defines reality not as a static set of entities, but as a dynamic process governed by three constitutive principles: Contextual Ontological Regimes (ChOR), Cohesive Synergy Index (KSS), and Paradoxical Permeability (PPU). The system introduces formal operators (Γ, Φ) and the concept of *Propertyness* as the minimal unit of ontological commitment, enabling rigorous modeling of nonlocal, quantum-cognitive, and emergent phenomena.
