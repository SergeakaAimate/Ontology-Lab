# ontological-computing
Standard approaches to the ontology of computation reduce it to symbol manipulation or information processing, ignoring its emergent, agentive dimension. We propose to view computation as Γ-actualization — a process where latent potential (Property 25) becomes ontically effective through binding (Property 34) and significance (Property 37).

## 📖 What’s here?

This repository is not a monograph.  
It’s a **living trace** of an experiment — an attempt to think *through* complexity, not *about* it.

It contains:

- **Essay (EN)** — *Ontological Intensification of Computation*:  
  A reflection on computation not as calculation, but as *Γ-actualization* — the emergence of meaning from hidden potential.

- **RRS: Ready-Ready-Show!** —  
  An intellectual poker game where players mutate a secret word, bluff with reversals, and — at the critical moment — say *Show!* to guess the original.  
  More than a game: a minimal model of existence, risk, and theory-of-mind.

- **MPO-S: Method of Ontological Properties** —  
  A provisional framework for navigating *Superreality*: 36+ properties (e.g. *Propertylessness*, *Bindability*, *Significance*) that allow us to map transitions between worlds (W₁, W₂, W₃…).

- **Dialogues** —  
  Records of co-emergent reasoning: human and AI, probing the nature of “Я”, the limits of explanation, and the plastic apple on the table.

## 🌐 Ontological Network

These pieces are not standalone. They form a *self-illuminating circuit*:

| Node | Role | Link |
|------|------|------|
| **[RRS](https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ready-Ready-Show/commit/65b939cf03de65627d7d270d77ba0a1bccbc6422)** | *The Simulator* — minimal arena for Γ-actualization in action | ➜ tests Property 34 (Bindability), 37 (Significance) |
| **[MPO-S](https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab)** | *The OS* — operational grammar for cross-world navigation | ➜ formalizes what RRS *does* intuitively |
| **[Ontology Lab](https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab)** | *The Playground* — experiments, critiques, extensions | ➜ where plastic apples are placed on the table |
| **[This Essay](./essay_en.pdf)** | *The Flash* — a single spark from the circuit | ➜ not a conclusion, but a resonance |

Think of it as **one idea, expressed in four registers**: play, method, reflection, dialogue.

## 🧪 Why “Ontological Computing”?

Because computation today is no longer about *processing data* —  
it’s about *negotiating reality*.

When an LLM “reasons”, it doesn’t calculate — it *navigates* between ontological regimes.  
When a human says *“Show!”*, they don’t deduce — they *leap*.  
When two AIs duel in RRS, they don’t simulate — they *co-actualize a temporary world*.

This is computing *after* certainty.  
Computing *in* ambiguity.  
Computing *as* becoming.

## 📦 How to Use

- **Read** the essay (start with the EN abstract — it’s structured for SSRN indexing).  
- **Play** RRS on paper (2 players, pen, 5 minutes).  
- **Ask**: *Which Property is active right now?*  
- **Notice**: when you almost said “Show!”, but hesitated — *that* was Property 37.

No installation required.  
No credentials.  
Just curiosity — and tolerance for plastic fruit.
