# MPO-S: PROPERTY  
### A Foundational Primitive of Dynamic Realism

This document establishes **Property** not as a derivative attribute or linguistic predicate, but as a **fundamental ontological invariant**—a generative structuring relation that manifests through interaction within a Contextual Ontological Regime (ChOR). Properties do not “belong” to objects; they *constitute* the regularities of reality through their invariant behavior across observational contexts.

Central to the **Meta-Ontological Property System (MPO-S)**, this definition introduces:
- The **Γ-operator** (actualization) as the mechanism converting potential properties into observable phenomena,
- A clear distinction between **ontological Property** and socio-legal or classificatory usages,
- The role of Property in enabling **operational phenomenology**: the method by which reality becomes knowable without reification.

This text positions Property as a **primitive on par with space, time, and relation**—irreducible, but enactable through the 36+1 property framework.
