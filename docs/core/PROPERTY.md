# MPO-S: PROPERTY

A foundational definition of Property within the Meta-System Ontology (MPO-S)—not as attribute or predicate, but as an invariant that structures reality itself.

## Abstract
This text defines Property as a fundamental ontological invariant: a stable relation that manifests through interaction within a Contextual Ontological Regime (ChOR). Properties do not “belong” to objects; they emerge as modes of reality’s organization, generating the regularities we interpret as “laws.” The document introduces the Γ-operator (actualization) as the mechanism through which potential properties become observable, and distinguishes Property from both classical attributes and legal/social constructs.

## Context
- Core to: [`/core`](/docs/core) — axiomatic and methodological foundations of Dynamic Realism  
- Builds on:  
  - ChOR → ∞ (unbounded layering of ontological regimes)  
  - KSS → ∞ (absolute interconnectivity)  
  - PPU → ∞ (paradox tolerance)  
- Directly informs:  
  - [`/essays/ontological-intensification-of-computation.md`](ontological-intensification-of-computation.md)  
  - [`/essays/table-of-contents-as-an-executable-interface-readme.md`](../essays/table-of-contents-as-an-executable-interface-readme.md)  
- Related to:  
  - Propertyness (ₚ) as metric of ontological complexity  
  - Bindability (Property 34) as actualization mechanism

## Note
This definition positions Property not as a derived concept, but as a primary ontological primitive—on par with space, time, or relation. It cannot be reduced; it can only be enacted. The full power of the MPO-S framework is required to operationalize it.
