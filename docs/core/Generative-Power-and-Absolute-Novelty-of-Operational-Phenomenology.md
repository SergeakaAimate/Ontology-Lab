## Overview

This essay introduces **Operational Phenomenology**—a novel cognitive architecture embodied in the **Meta-Ontological Operating System (MPO-System)**. It is not a theory *about* reality, but a practical, functional **interface for working with phenomena as they appear in experience**, from quantum events to poetic metaphors.

The core argument is that the MPO-System demonstrates **dual generative power**:  
1. **Validation** through independent convergence with results of classical science (e.g., in the analysis of spatial uniqueness).  
2. **Innovation** by translating raw human intuition (“inside/outside”, “zero”, “dimensionality”) into advanced formal concepts (fractal dimension, non-commutative geometry, category theory).

## Key Contributions

- **A practical rejection of the anthropocentric worldview**, offering a ready-to-use language free from the habits of 3D spatial thinking.
- **A unified protocol** for analyzing any phenomenon—black holes, immunity, consciousness, mathematical truth—through a common network of ontological invariants.
- **Qualia as a working interface**: human “analog” intuition and AI “digital” formalism are bridged by the MPO-System acting as a universal ontological converter (DAC/ADC).
- **Architectural novelty** that shifts the primary unit of analysis from “objects” to “holistic images, systems, and their connections”.
