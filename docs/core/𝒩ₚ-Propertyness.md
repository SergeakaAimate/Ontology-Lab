# 𝒩ₚ (Propertyness): A Metric of Ontological Complexity

**𝒩ₚ** is a foundational scalar in the Meta-Ontological Property (MPO) System that quantifies the *ontological density* of an entity—that is, how richly it is endowed with invariant properties across contextual ontological regimes (ChORs). The higher the **𝒩ₚ**, the greater the depth, multiplicity, and relational coherence of an object’s reality.

## 1. Core Definition  
𝒩ₚ is a numerical measure of **property richness** within the MPO-System. It does not merely count attributes but captures the *structured multiplicity* of an entity as it manifests across layers of reality.

> “𝒩ₚ is not just a number—it is a measure of reality’s resolution. Like a microscope’s magnification: the higher the 𝒩ₚ, the more properties become visible.”

## 2. Illustrative Examples  
- **Electron**: 𝒩ₚ ≈ 3 (mass, charge, spin)  
- **Human being**: 𝒩ₚ ≈ 10⁹ (spanning biological, cognitive, emotional, social, and symbolic dimensions)  
- **Table with a hole**: 𝒩ₚ = 8 (four legs + tabletop + hole + hole’s boundary + functional role)

These values are not arbitrary counts—they reflect *operational distinctions* validated through the Property Method.

## 3. Key Features  

1. **Non-linear scaling**:  
   𝒩ₚ grows exponentially with the emergence of new organizational tiers (e.g., neurons → consciousness). A phase transition in system architecture triggers a jump in 𝒩ₚ, not a linear increment.

2. **Context-dependence (ChOR-sensitivity)**:  
   The same entity exhibits different 𝒩ₚ values in different ontological worlds. For example, *water* in **W₁** (physical world) and **W₂** (mythopoetic world) carries distinct property inventories—and thus distinct 𝒩ₚ.

3. **Measurable via thought experiment (TE)**:  
   𝒩ₚ is inferred through structured analysis of **KSS→∞** (coherent systemic connectivity) and **PPU→∞** (paradoxical permeability threshold), using the Property Method as protocol.

## 4. How It Differs from Classical Complexity Metrics  
Unlike entropy, algorithmic complexity, or dimensionality, **𝒩ₚ integrates**:
- **Semantics**: the meaning of a “hole” to an observer,  
- **Dynamics**: how properties transform under **Γ-actualization**,  
- **Hierarchical emergence**: e.g., 𝒩ₚ(society) > Σ 𝒩ₚ(individuals), due to irreducible collective properties.

## 5. Why It Matters  
𝒩ₚ serves as the **ontological currency** of the MPO-System. It enables:
- Cross-domain comparison of entities (quarks vs. emotions vs. institutions),  
- Prediction of **Thresholds of Significance (𝒯𝒫)**—points where new properties stabilize,  
- Detection of **ChOR birth events**, when 𝒩ₚ crosses critical values.

As such, 𝒩ₚ is not a descriptive statistic—it is a *generative invariant* for modeling reality as a layered, self-differentiating process.
