# Propertyness (𝒩ₚ) — Metric of Ontological Complexity

## Abstract  
𝒩ₚ is a numerical measure of the "saturation" of an object or system with properties within the MPO-System. A higher 𝒩ₚ corresponds to a richer, more multifaceted reality of the object.

## Core Definition  
𝒩ₚ quantifies ontological depth by counting how many properties (from the 36+1 set of the [MPO-System](MPO-S-v1-0-0.pdf)) are meaningfully instantiated in a given object across relevant ChORs (ontological regimes).

## Conceptual Anchoring  

- **Exemplary Values**:  
  - Electron: 𝒩ₚ ≈ 3 (mass, charge, spin)  
  - Human being: 𝒩ₚ ≈ 10⁹ (biological, cognitive, social strata)  
  - Table with a hole: 𝒩ₚ = 8 (4 legs + tabletop + hole + its boundaries + function)

## Key Characteristics  

1. **Nonlinear Scaling**: 𝒩ₚ grows exponentially with the emergence of new organizational levels (e.g., neurons → consciousness).  
2. **ChOR-Dependence**: An object manifests different 𝒩ₚ across distinct worlds (e.g., water in [W₁](/docs/essays/Uniqueness-of-Space.pdf) vs. W₂).  
3. **Measurable via Thought Experiment**: Determined through analysis of [connectivity (KSS)](MPO-S-v1-0-0.pdf) and [paradoxical permeability (PPU)](MPO-S-v1-0-0.pdf).

## Distinction from Classical Complexity Metrics  

𝒩ₚ incorporates not only physical parameters, but also:  
- Semantics (the meaning of a “hole” for an observer),  
- Dynamics (how properties transform under [Γ-actualization](MPO-S-v1-0-0.pdf)),  
- Hierarchies (e.g., 𝒩ₚ of a society > Σ𝒩ₚ of its individuals).

## Systemic Significance  

𝒩ₚ functions as the fundamental “currency” of the MPO-System, enabling:  
- Cross-domain complexity comparison (from quarks to love),  
- Prediction of significance thresholds (𝒯𝒫),  
- Detection of novel ChOR emergence.

> “𝒩ₚ is not merely a number—it is a measure of reality's depth. Like a microscope's resolution: the higher the 𝒩ₚ, the more properties become discernible.”
