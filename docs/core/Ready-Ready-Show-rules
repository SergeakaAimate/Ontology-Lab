# Ready-Ready-Show! (RRS) — Core Rules

A minimal, universal game of deduction, risk, and reconstruction. RRS is not about vocabulary—it is a cognitive microscope for observing how mind operates under uncertainty.

## Abstract

Two players each select a hidden six-letter word. They then alter their word—letter by letter—building a public history of changes. At any moment after three moves, a player may call **“Show!”**, challenging the opponent to reveal their current word and then guessing the *original*. One guess. Sixty seconds. Everything is at stake.

Beneath this simplicity lies a profound structure: RRS models the act of reconstructing hidden states from visible traces—a core operation of human and artificial intelligence alike.

## Core Principles

- **Reconstruction over recall**: The challenge is not memory, but inference from a chain of transformations.  
- **Bluff as strategy**: Returning to the original word is a legitimate tactic to mislead.  
- **Risk as climax**: “Show!” is an existential decision—beyond calculation, into will.  
- **Universal substrate**: The game abstracts seamlessly to numbers, colors, sets, theorems, or any transformable object.

## Note

This document resides in `/core` because it defines a foundational mechanic of the Property Method: the interplay of **Bindability**, **Salience**, and **Uncertainty** in acts of reconstruction. It is not a game manual—it is a protocol for ontological inquiry.
