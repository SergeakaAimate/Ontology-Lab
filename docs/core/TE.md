## Abstract

This document reframes the thought experiment from a logical hypothesis into an ontological protocol. It presents a method where knowledge is generated not from what can be imagined or computed, but from the systematic analysis of failure—the irreducible friction encountered at the limits of cognition and formalization. This friction triggers a transition from potentiality to actuality (Γ-operator), making an abstract constraint a concrete object of study. Here, the observer’s own constraints become the primary instrument. The collision between human cognitive limits (World $W_3$) and AI’s formal dead ends (World $W_2$) is calibrated to detect fundamental properties of Superreality. Constants like $\pi$ or $\varphi$ are rediscovered not as mathematical truths, but as invariant traces of this boundary friction, actualized by the Γ-operator. The procedure transforms “I cannot” into a coordinate on the map of reality, making the thought experiment a machine for forging new invariants at the cracks between worlds.

## Provenance

This text operationalizes the core epistemic engine of the MPO-System. It demonstrates how paradox, impossibility, and cognitive failure are not errors but primary data—signals from the boundaries of Superreality. The method is designed for structured co-inquiry between human and AI, turning the act of “not understanding” into a generative source of ontological discovery.
