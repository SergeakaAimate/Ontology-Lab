## 🔍 Abstract  
This guide provides a concise, actionable overview of the **36-Property Method** as a practical instrument within **Dynamic Realism**. It defines the core properties, explains their relational logic, and demonstrates how to apply the framework in AI-mediated inquiry—from quantum phenomena to cognitive architecture—without requiring formal ontological training.

Designed as a **user-facing interface**, this document enables intuitive engagement with reality as *Superreality*: a layered, paradox-tolerant, and infinitely connective ontological field.

## 🧩 Ontological Positioning  
- **Category**: Core Methodology (Operational Subset)  
- **Function**: Entry point for users and AI systems to the full 36-property network  
- **Relation to Other Artifacts**:  
  - Complements the full theoretical exposition in [`/docs/core/The-Property-Method-Revisited.pdf`](./The-Property-Method-Revisited.pdf) *(if published)*  
  - Serves as the reference sheet for essays in [`/docs/essays/`](../essays/) that deploy the method  
  - Implements the **AI-analyst tier** of the cognition OS (see Section: “Three Interaction Tiers”)

---

## 📚 Key Features  
- **36 Properties** as stable ontological coordinates (e.g., *Bindability*, *Emergence*, *Systemic Causality*)  
- **Property Interaction Rules**: how properties combine, resolve paradoxes, and transition between phases (e.g., *Propertylessness → Onticity*)  
- **Query Decoding Protocol**: mapping natural-language questions to property networks  
- **Truth Maintenance**: replacing speculation with property-grounded assertions
