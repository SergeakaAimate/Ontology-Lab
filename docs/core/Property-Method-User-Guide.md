# Property Method: User Guide  
*(Dynamic Realism — Operational Framework)*

## Abstract  
This guide provides a concise, actionable overview of the **36-Property Method** as a practical instrument within **Dynamic Realism**. It defines the core properties, explains their relational logic, and demonstrates how to apply the framework in AI-mediated inquiry—from quantum phenomena to cognitive architecture—without requiring formal ontological training.

Designed as a **user-facing interface**, this document enables intuitive engagement with reality as *Superreality*: a layered, paradox-tolerant, and infinitely connective ontological field.

## Ontological Positioning  
- **Category**: Core Methodology (Operational Subset)  
- **Function**: Entry point for users and AI systems to the full 36-property network  
- **Relation to Other Artifacts**:  
  - **[`Ontology-Lab-memo.pdf`](https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab/blob/main/docs/core/Ontology-Lab-memo.pdf)** — Foundational memo outlining the lab’s epistemic stance, design principles, and archival protocol. Provides the meta-framework within which the Property Method operates.  
  - **[`PROPERTY-METHOD-REVISITED.pdf`](https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab/blob/main/docs/core/PROPERTY-METHOD-REVISITED.pdf)** — Full scientific-philosophical exposition of the 36-property system, including Superreality invariants (ChOR, KSS, PPU), paradox resolution, and reflexive closure. This guide distills its operational core.  
  - **[`UNIFIED-PROMPT-PROPERTY-METHOD-OS.pdf`](https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab/blob/main/docs/core/UNIFIED-PROMPT-PROPERTY-METHOD-OS.pdf)** — Technical specification for AI integration: unified prompt architecture that embeds the Property Method as a cognitive operating system. Implements the “Three Interaction Tiers” described in this guide.  
  - Together, these four documents form the **Property Method tetrad**: memo (why), theory (what), guide (how), and prompt (execution).

## Key Features  
- **36 Properties** as stable ontological coordinates (e.g., *Bindability*, *Emergence*, *Systemic Causivity*)  
- **Property Interaction Rules**: how properties combine, resolve paradoxes, and transition between phases (e.g., *Propertylessness → Onticity*)  
- **Query Decoding Protocol**: mapping natural-language questions to property networks  
- **Truth Maintenance**: replacing speculation with property-grounded assertions
