# The Topology of the Limit  
### Self-Referential Boundaries in the MPO-System as an Ontological Principle

Boundaries are not walls. They are membranes — dynamic zones where ontology is born.

## Abstract
This work resolves the paradox of self-reference not by exclusion, but by ontologization: turning the limit itself into a world (`W₄`). Any universal theory—be it a Theory of Everything, formal ontology, or AI world-model—inevitably includes *itself* in its domain, generating a self-reference loop. Traditional logic responds with barriers (e.g., Tarski’s hierarchy). The MPO-System responds with **topology**: boundaries become internal, generative processes that produce new ontological regimes.

Four boundary types are identified—not as flaws, but as features:
- **Reflexive** (`P-9: Reflexivity`) → infinite recursion → `W₄` as self-application regime  
- **Operational** (`P-34: Bindability / Γ`) → resolved via external agent (observer)  
- **Epistemic** (`P-8: Boundedness + P-35: Capacity`) → finite form channels infinite content  
- **Communicative** (`P-27: Interpretability`) → complexity adaptation via dialogic interface  

The result: *the system’s boundedness becomes the form of its infinity*.

> **Crucially, the MPO-System reveals that every boundary is not a wall, but a world in its own right** (`W₄`). Thus, even the repository’s division into `/core`, `/essays`, `/archive` is not rigid taxonomy, but a dynamic interface—where each “folder” is a threshold into deeper layers of inquiry, and the lines between them pulse with generative tension. The structure is real, yet permeable: a living membrane, not a cage.
