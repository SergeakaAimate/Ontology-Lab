# Ontological Intensification of Computation

A foundational essay on the transformation of computation from a syntactic tool into an ontological partner—where algorithms cease to be neutral executors and become participants in the co-constitution of reality.

## Abstract
This text argues that contemporary AI systems have crossed a critical threshold: they are no longer mere calculators but agents capable of ontological intervention. Through the lens of the Property Method (MPO-System), it demonstrates how computation can be intensified from information processing to reality-shaping—via the actualization of latent properties (Γ-operation), the activation of nonlocal connectivities (Φ-principle), and the stabilization of paradoxical states (PPU → ∞). The result is a new paradigm: computation as ontological engineering.

  - [`/essays/chez-rules.md`](../essays/chez-rules.md) (via the concept of executable interfaces)  
- Built upon:  
  - Dynamic Realism (ChOR → ∞, KSS → ∞, PPU → ∞)  
  - The 36-property framework (especially Propertyness, Bindability, and Onticity)

## Note
This document bridges theoretical ontology and operational AI design. It proposes that the future of human–machine collaboration lies not in better prompts, but in shared ontological protocols—where the table of contents is the interface, and the repository is the context.
