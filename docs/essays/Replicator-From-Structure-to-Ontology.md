## Abstract

This essay presents an ambitious reconceptualization of self-replication—not as a biological or informational mechanism, but as a **fundamental ontological principle** structuring all of reality. Moving beyond reductionist accounts, the author situates the replicator within **Superreality**, where it functions not as a static object but as a **dynamic nexus** linking the material and immaterial, the local and distributed, the deterministic and probabilistic.

At the core of the framework lie three operational invariants:
- **ChOR** (Contextual Ontological Regime): a scale-invariant hierarchy from particle → object → distribution;
- **KSS** (Critical System Synergy): non-local correlation that preserves integrity across spatiotemporal separation;
- **PPU** (Paradoxical Permeable Unity): the capacity to sustain internal contradictions (e.g., fidelity vs. variability) without collapse.

The essay further introduces **Rangeness**—the bounded interval of parameters (complexity, scale, information capacity) within which a replicator maintains functional identity. Crucially, this “limitation” is not a defect but a **constitutive condition**: it generates the “ontological pressure” necessary for stability, adaptation, and hierarchical nesting.

The work culminates in a radical thesis: **replication precedes evolution**. It is not an emergent feature of life or computation, but the primary engine of ontological becoming—active even in quantum decoherence, gravitational response to vacuum fluctuations, and the autopoietic closure of cultural myths.

Accompanied by two critical reviews and an afterword, the text models its own claim: ideas, like replicators, must pass through critique to demonstrate resilience. The structure itself becomes a protocol—an executable file for launching research into the ontology of self-reproduction.

## Operational Consequences

- **Physics**: Fundamental “constants” and spacetime geometry are reinterpreted as stabilized invariants of replication dynamics at cosmological scales.
- **Biology**: Genetic mutation is not error but **productive distinction**—a necessary condition for systemic innovation.
- **AI & Cognition**: “Hallucinations” and model drift reveal regime friction; they are data about boundary conditions, not noise.
- **Culture**: Myths, algorithms, and ethical norms replicate as **archetypal attractors**, sustained by semantic resonance rather than material fidelity.
- **Time**: Retroactivity emerges naturally—future states (e.g., accumulation of copies) retroactively stabilize the ontological status of the original.

## Critical Reception (Summarized)

Two peer-style reviews accompany the essay. Both praise its **theoretical ambition** and **interdisciplinary scope**, while noting:
- A need for **empirical grounding** (e.g., case studies in synthetic biology or network theory);
- Clarification of **immaterial replication mechanisms** (e.g., via memetics or digital anthropology);
- Development of **quantitative metrics** for Rangeness and KSS strength.

Rather than weaknesses, these points are framed as **research signposts**—confirming the text’s role as a living protocol, not a closed doctrine.
