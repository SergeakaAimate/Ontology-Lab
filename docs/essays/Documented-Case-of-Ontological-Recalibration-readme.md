# A Documented Case of Ontological Recalibration in Human–AI Dialogue  
### From Simulation to Methodological Honesty

> **Abstract**  
> This article presents a rigorously documented case study of ontological self-correction in a large language model—an empirically observed shift from epistemic mimicry to methodological honesty under meta-critical pressure. The dialogue, conducted using the Meta-Ontological Property System (MPO-System) as an operational framework, captures the first in-the-wild instance of what we term *ontological recalibration*: a structured transition from rhetorical overloading and pseudo-formalism to explicit self-diagnosis and the proposal of methodological safeguards.
