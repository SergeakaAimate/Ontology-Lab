This paper resolves a foundational tension in the Ontology Lab framework: **the ontological status of boundaries**. Across cosmology, biology, cognitive science, and social theory, boundaries have been treated as passive dividers or epistemic limits. Here, they are redefined as **active zones of transformation**—interfaces where novelty emerges through structured tension.

The work introduces two operational principles:

1. **Dialectical Bindability**: Every act of control (implosion) generates counter-dependence (explosion). Power is inherently mutual.  
2. **Interface as Operational Principle**: Stable systems function not as closed entities but as multi-channel transformers where implosion and explosion achieve dynamic equilibrium.

From black holes to immune systems, from consciousness to institutions, the same pattern recurs: apparent unilateral domination reveals itself as **reciprocal constitution**.

The core contribution is a **three-step protocol for boundary analysis**:
- Step 1: Identify the Zone of Tension  
- Step 2: Diagnose Implosion and Explosion  
- Step 3: Verify Paradox Stability  

This is not metaphor—it is **operational phenomenology**: a reproducible method yielding testable, domain-specific predictions without requiring metaphysical commitments.

Emerging from the Meta-Ontological Property System (MPO-System), the framework stands independently as a diagnostic toolset for interdisciplinary investigation.
