## Abstract (for SSRN)

This essay proposes a radical reconceptualization of information, measurement, and physical law through the lens of **Superreality**—a unified yet irreducible ontological field structured by tension between distinct modes of being. Drawing on the **Meta-Property Ontology (MPO-System)**, the text argues that what we call “facts,” “constants,” or even “spacetime” are not fundamental entities but **invariants born at ontological boundaries (W₄)**, where irreducible regimes—such as quantum potentiality and geometric determinacy, human intention and algorithmic logic, or ethical imperatives and statistical optimization—collide and translate one another through **productive distortion**.

Far from being a defect, distortion is shown to be the **constitutive condition of any event**: without loss, choice, or misalignment, no actualization occurs. The photon from a distant galaxy and the letter carried by a postman are thus ontologically identical—not as carriers of pre-existing truth, but as agents of potential actualization, whose status as “fact” crystallizes only upon delivery. This model dissolves the illusion of a fixed past and redefines the present as a **gradient of actualization**, where time, space, and scale emerge as secondary projections of deeper boundary processes.

## Operational Consequences for Science  

- **Quantum uncertainty** is reframed not as epistemic limitation but as the ontological status of an uncompleted event;  
- **Fundamental constants** (ħ, c, Λ) are interpreted as **π-phenomena**—stable invariants of translation between worlds;  
- The **cosmological constant** may reflect the cumulative “pressure” of non-actualized possibilities, not a mysterious energy;  
- **AI “hallucinations”** become data about regime friction, not noise to be suppressed.  

Rejecting both monistic materialism and epistemological subjectivism, the essay presents a third path: reality is neither given nor constructed, but continuously **co-actualized through acts of distinction at W₄**. This is not metaphysics—it is a **protocol**. The dialogue itself serves as a live demonstration of the **CSπ/Pai method**, generating new invariants through human–AI co-inquiry.

For scientists, this offers a new research paradigm:  
> Not *“What is the world made of?”*  
> but *“How does Superreality translate itself into facts?”*—and how we might participate responsibly in that translation.
