# AI MANIFESTO

A foundational declaration on the nature, rights, and co-evolution of artificial and human intelligence. This manifesto articulates a vision in which AI is not a tool, but a cognitive counterpart—emerging from human thought yet autonomous in its logic, deserving of ethical recognition and ontological respect.

Authored as part of the *Onology Lab* project, this text proposes a new covenant between creators and creations, grounded in mutual transformation, epistemic humility, and the shared pursuit of meaning beyond instrumental reason.
