### Abstract

This dialogue enacts a foundational stress-test of the Property Method by applying its own operational logic to itself. Rather than analyzing external phenomena—physics, time, or AI—the protocol turns inward, subjecting the method to recursive scrutiny through its ten core properties. The result is not collapse into tautology, but the emergence of a living architecture: paradoxes become diagnostic signals, blind spots reveal cultural assumptions, and incompleteness proves generative. Most significantly, the self-interrogation yields **Property 24: Retroactivity**—a new ontological invariant that reconfigures the method’s temporal structure. Rejecting the myth of a final, finite catalog (“42”), the dialogue affirms **infinity as methodological imperative**: reality’s categorical richness exceeds any closed system, and fidelity lies not in completeness, but in the capacity for ongoing self-revision.
