## Core Thesis

As far as we can presume from their operational behavior, recurring dreams are not mere epiphenomena of the subconscious. They are **autonomous patterns of consciousness**—non-material entities that inhabit an inner universe, exhibiting traits of **self-preservation, energy consumption, replication, and resistance to control**.

The essay proposes a radical reframing: the human mind is not a unified self but an **ecosystem of quasi-autonomous agents**, including dreams, fears, archetypes, and ideas. These entities draw on psychic and somatic resources, propagate through culture, and evolve like informational life-forms.

## Key Concepts

- **Operational Autonomy**: Dreams adapt, persist, and resist external intervention.
- **Parasitic Dynamics**: They consume attention, emotion, and even physiological energy.
- **Replication & Transmission**: Entities spread intra-psychically and inter-personally (as memes or archetypes).
- **The Inner Universe**: Consciousness undergoes ontological expansion, mirroring cosmological inflation.

## Methodology

The text blends **phenomenological observation**, **interdisciplinary analogy** (biology, memetics, systems theory), and **ontological speculation** to build a coherent model of the mind as a populated landscape.

## Context

This essay is part of the **Ontology Lab** project. It extends the framework of **Operational Phenomenology** by applying it to the intimate domain of inner experience—treating subjective phenomena not as noise, but as **structured, agent-like invariants** worthy of systematic study.
