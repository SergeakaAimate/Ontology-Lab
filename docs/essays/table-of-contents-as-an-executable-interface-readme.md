# The Table of Contents as an Executable Interface  
### Protocol as Foundational Architecture for Human–AI Cognitive Collaboration

> **Abstract**  
> The prevailing paradigm of human–AI collaboration is broken. To engage with large language models, users must perform exhaustive "context loading"—manually curating and uploading textual corpora. This process is not only inefficient but epistemically reductive, stripping away the interstices, contradictions, and raw associations where genuine insight is born. The core problem is not that AI cannot understand our archives, but that our archives are not built for understanding. They are storerooms, not interfaces.  
>  
> This paper proposes a paradigm shift: from the archive-as-repository to the archive-as-interface. We introduce a protocol-centric architectural framework where a knowledge repository is designed from the outset as an executable specification for dialogue. The framework is built upon a tripartite structure: `/core` (constitutive axioms and primitives), `/essays` (executed reasoning trajectories), and `/archive` (a strategic reservoir of unformed potential). These layers form a dynamic cognitive ecology—a "heat engine of thought"—where the managed tension between order and chaos performs the work of understanding.
