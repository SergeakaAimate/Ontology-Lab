## Abstract

A real-time philosophical experiment testing the limits of cognition through dialogue. The text introduces the concept of the **Killer Question (KQ)** — a class of existential-metaphysical questions whose correct formulation induces cognitive-ontological destabilization of the questioning system itself. Unlike "eternal" or "cursed" questions, a KQ does not merely challenge but *destroys* the epistemic foundations upon which it is posed.

The dialogue applies the **Property Method (MPO-System)** to itself under conditions of reflexive stress-testing, examining:
- How philosophical systems avoid the practical consequences of their own insights (e.g., recognizing the primacy of affects while refusing their technologization)
- The vulnerability of any method — including MPO — to self-subversion when confronted with its own paradoxes
- The boundary between contemplation and engineering of cognition
- The role of theology not as "ballast" but as a methodological invariant marking irreducible limits

## Structural Nodes

### Part 1. Killer Questions
- Problem formulation as epistemic condition  
- Distinction: *eternal questions* (stimulate reflection) vs. *cursed questions* (ethical taboos) vs. *killer questions* (systemic collapse)  
- The "sect method": circumventing meaning through epistemic violence  
- Philosophy's avoidance of "engineering the soul" despite acknowledging affective primacy  
- Property Method architecture applied to question deconstruction (36 properties, ChOR/KSS/PPU axiomatics)

### Part 2. Killer Chests
- Nietzsche's "Great Noon" as KQ: achievement annihilates the driving force  
- Dionysius the Areopagite vs. Nietzsche: apophatic vs. cataphatic abyss  
- Apostle Paul's "through a glass, darkly" as epistemic humility vs. science's "non-human languages"  
- Quantum measurement analogy: the act of analysis collapses the living question  
- MPO as OS for AI cognition, not calculator — demands operational verification (Λ ∝ 1/PPU, Nₚ > 10⁶)  
- Open protocol transition: falsifiability as survival criterion ("If predictions don't materialize in 5 years — the method dies")
