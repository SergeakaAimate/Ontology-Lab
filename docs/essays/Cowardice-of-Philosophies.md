## Scope

Applied ontological investigation examining the epistemic limitations of monistic philosophical frameworks. The essay critiques the reduction of irreducible ontological worlds to a single explanatory principle and analyses the methodological consequences of such reductionism for AI-mediated inquiry.

## Core propositions

- Monistic approaches constitute a form of epistemic cowardice: the refusal to sustain dialogue between ontologically distinct worlds
- Scientific monism (e.g., attempts to reduce quantum phenomena to general relativity or vice versa) exemplifies logically inconsistent boundary-crossing
- Genuine philosophical courage manifests as sustained engagement with irreducible multiplicity through structured dialogue
- The MPO-System provides methodological tools for navigating boundary processes without collapse into singularity

## Structural elements

1. Diagnosis of monistic reduction as avoidance of ontological responsibility  
2. Analysis of boundary violations between irreducible worlds  
3. Dialogical format demonstrating performance of cross-world communication  
4. Methodological prescription: property-based inquiry as alternative to substance metaphysics

## Key concepts

`monism` `ontological boundaries` `dialogue-of-worlds` `MPO-System` `epistemic courage` `reductionism` `boundary processes` `property method` `Superreality`
