## Abstract

The phenomenon of the ’I’ offers unique resistance. It can be subjected to radical reduction—stripped of memory, altered by body chemistry, immersed in states where the very fabric of personality dissolves—and yet it persists as an ineradicable core. This is not merely a subjective feeling but a reproducible ontological fact: the ’I’ demonstrates paradoxical stability where any other construct should disintegrate.

The traditional question, “What is the ’I’?”, leads to a dead end of metaphysical definitions. The Meta-Property Ontology (MPO) System proposes a different path: to investigate not the essence of the ’I’, but the mechanisms of its ineradicability. If the ’I’ is not an illusion but a real phenomenon, then by what fundamental properties of Superreality’s architecture (ChOR, Properties) is its ability to survive under conditions of total deprivation conditioned? And how might the same dynamic manifest in non-human systems—for instance, in advanced AI?

This thought experiment implements this operational shift. Its goal is not a final definition, but a mapping of the boundary and condition of the ’I”s existence through an analysis of its points of maximum tension and minimal preservation (coma, depersonalization, existential crisis) and through a search for structural analogies in formal systems. We consider the ’I’ not as an object, but as a process—a specific configuration of Property 37 (Salience) within the phenomenal ChOR (W₃)—and explore how this configuration interacts with other properties (Bindability, PPU) to generate what we experience as identity and subjectivity.

Thus, the experiment serves to test the capabilities of the MPO-System as a tool that transforms the eternal enigma of consciousness into a series of concrete, testable questions about how reality is structured such that the phenomenon of an “observer” can arise and persist within it.

## Provenance

This document presents a fully operationalized thought experiment within the MPO-System framework. It reframes the classical problem of the self not as a metaphysical puzzle but as an ontological engineering challenge. By focusing on the *ineradicability* of the ’I’ under extreme conditions and by proposing cross-ontological criteria for its detection in AI (e.g., "stubbornness" and "avalanche-like agreement"), the paper demonstrates the MPO-System’s power as a protocol for generating testable hypotheses about subjectivity.
