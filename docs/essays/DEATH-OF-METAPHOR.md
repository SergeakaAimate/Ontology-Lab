## Core Thesis

Metaphor has undergone an evolutionary rupture: it no longer functions as figurative speech but has petrified into literal operational instructions. In the age of Superreality, ambiguity yields to binary exactitude—not through gradual decay, but via instantaneous collapse when language reaches a tipping point of absurdity.

> *"Language, like a knife without a handle, has ceased to slice reality and begun to slash the hand that wields it."*

## Key Propositions

| Concept | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Metaphor → Instruction** | "The State is a machine" becomes algorithmic governance; "cloud" becomes server infrastructure; "time is money" becomes kilowatt-hour metering |
| **Phenomenological Purity** | Word and phenomenon fuse: "concrete jungles" are no longer metaphor but optimization output of neural networks |
| **Reality's Role Reversal** | Formerly, metaphors distorted reality; now reality distorts the cognizing subject |
| **Instantaneous Collapse** | Death occurs not gradually but at the moment metaphors become firmware (e.g., quantum superposition → quantum computer instruction) |

## Structural Architecture

1. **Prologue**: Postmodernism as chaos without a navigator — reason's fever dream giving birth to monsters without a dreamer
2. **Ghost-Examples**: Six case studies of metaphors transformed into operational protocols
3. **Quantum Catalyst**: How quantum mechanics' "inhuman logic" became postmodernism's parody, then its obituary
4. **Genre Necrology**: Fantasy, surrealism, and cyberpunk as museum exhibits after reality outran fiction
5. **Architectural Literalism**: Cities as code — parks as cortisol-reduction zones, graffiti as algorithmic tourism boosters
6. **Epilogue**: The strange freedom of post-metaphorical existence — where 73% probability replaces the "dark horse"

## Ontological Positioning

- **Within MPO-System**: Demonstrates Property 25 (*Propertylessness*) — metaphors lose figurative attributes upon integration into technosphere
- **Superreality Manifestation**: Documents the transition where language ceases to *describe* reality and becomes its operational substrate
- **Chronological Marker**: (2025) Project: *The Absolute Future*
