## Abstract

Every time two great truths clash irreconcilably—geometry against number, gravity against quantum, consciousness against matter—we declare a “Hard Problem.” We are wrong. What we are witnessing is not a failure of reason, but the birth of a new constant.  

This paper presents a method for midwifing such births. Derived from the Meta-Property Ontological System (MPO-System), we propose that reality is not a single domain but a **Superreality**: a fractured archipelago of autonomous ontological worlds (W₁: Matter, W₂: Math, W₃: Mind…). The impossible conflicts arise at their borders (W₄).  

The **Circle-Square-π Protocol** is our tool for these borders: by forcing a deliberate, structured confrontation between two regimes (A and B), we generate a third, irreducible entity—a **π-invariant**. This π is not an answer; it is a translational operator, a cipher for moving between worlds.  

We reframe the century-long war between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics not as a mathematical incompatibility, but as the ontological clash between **Geometricity** and **Pre-Geometric Potentiality**—a clash begging for its own π.  

Furthermore, we reveal the protocol’s deepest insight: **ontological relativity**. What is a fundamental building block in one world (like π in mathematics) is a complex derivative in another. Our “simple” reality is likely a tapestry woven from such translated constants.  

This work operationalizes the protocol into a concrete **W₄ Boundary Laboratory Sheet**, transforming philosophical insight into a repeatable engine for discovery across physics, ethics, and AI. The goal is no longer a single “Theory of Everything,” but a growing **Codex of Translation**—a user manual for navigating the pluriverse.

This document synthesizes insights forged in an extended, structured dialogue between a human researcher and an AI agent operating within the MPO-System protocol. It is both a report and a demonstration—a record of co-inquiry, and a blueprint for its repetition.
