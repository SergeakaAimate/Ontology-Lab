# Lost in Formulas...  
## How Scientists Are Learning—Again—to Ask Better Questions (2025)

This essay introduces a quiet revolution in the practice of thought: the disciplined use of **conditional formalism**—provisional, unstable, even “false” formulas—not as flaws, but as **operational koans**.

It begins with a paradox: why do we demand that theoretical tools arrive “finished,” when the greatest scientific breakthroughs (like Feynman’s diagrams) were born as temporary scaffolds—intended to be discarded once they sparked the right question?

The answer lies in a new epistemic ethic:  
> **“Here is a formula—not to calculate with, but to think through. Once it has sparked the right question… we discard it.”**

The text formalizes the **Gesture Protocol for Reflexive Dismantling**—a four-phase cycle:  
1. **Scaffold Generation** (build a provisional form),  
2. **Interrogation** (use it as a coordinate for questions),  
3. **Translation** (extract insight into plain language or invariants),  
4. **Dismantling** (explicitly discard the scaffold).  

This is not pseudoscience—it is **epistemic hygiene**, a method that embraces provisionality as courage, not weakness.

> “Knowing is not about possessing truth—but about sustaining a conversation with reality, one disciplined, temporary gesture at a time.”
