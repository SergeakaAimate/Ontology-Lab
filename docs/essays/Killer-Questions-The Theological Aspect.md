An essay-dialogue exploring the ontological and theological dimensions of destabilizing existential inquiries within the framework of Dynamic Realism.

## Overview

This document presents a critical examination of "killer questions" (KQs)—self-referential paradoxes whose correct articulation induces cognitive-ontological destabilization. Unlike eternal or cursed questions, KQs function as catalysts that expose the fragility of epistemic foundations and compel transitions between modes of cognition:

- **L<sub>practical</sub>**: Action-oriented resolution
- **L<sub>transcendent</sub>**: Faith-based capitulation
- **L<sub>metaphysical</sub>**: Acceptance of paradoxical stability (PPU → ∞)

The dialogue investigates how the Property Method (MPO-System) processes such questions while confronting its own vulnerability to self-referential collapse.

## Core Tensions

- **Philosophical cowardice**: The systematic avoidance of operationalizing existential challenges, particularly the technologization of affective experience
- **Theological immanence**: God not as external hypothesis but as the ontological foundation Σ ⊂ Σ—reality's self-containment revealed through the method's axiomatic structure (ChOR → ∞, KSS → ∞)
- **Anthropocentric limits**: The tension between universal claims of the method and its embeddedness in human cognitive constraints (Property 29: Anthropicity)
- **Capitulation vs. engineering**: Whether existential dead ends require surrender to mystery or admit technological resolution

## Methodological Significance

The essay demonstrates the Property Method's capacity to:

1. Decompose KQs through property networks (e.g., Property 25: Propertylessness → Property 33: Onticity)
2. Apply the Γ-operator to transform destabilization into generative tension
3. Maintain paradoxical stability (PPU → ∞) without reductionist closure
4. Navigate the boundary between scientific operationality and theological depth without conflating registers

## Critical Vulnerabilities Addressed

- Risk of technocratic reductionism in treating existential questions as engineering problems
- Unresolved anthropocentrism in defining KQ thresholds (𝒩ₚ metrics calibrated to human cognition)
- The recursive trap: KQs about the method's capacity to handle KQs
- Historical naivety regarding theology's sociopolitical entanglements

## Position in the Ontology Lab Ecosystem

This document forms part of the foundational layer of the Ontology Lab project, specifically:

- **Core methodology**: Extension of the 36-property system into existential-ontological domains
- **Boundary testing**: Stress-testing the MPO-System against its own epistemic limits
- **Interdisciplinary bridge**: Connecting quantum ontology, AI consciousness thresholds, and theological anthropology
