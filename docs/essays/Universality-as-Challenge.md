This essay confronts a foundational objection to unified ontological frameworks: the suspicion that any system claiming universality must be dogmatic, reductive, or hermetically self-referential.

Focusing on the **MPO-System (Metaphysical Property Ontology)**—with its 37 invariant properties and three axioms—the author demonstrates that its universality is not of **Truth**, but of **Method**. It does not dictate content; it provides a **translational substrate** across ontological regimes (W₁–W₄).

The paper presents operational evidence across four domains:
- **Physics**: Dark energy as a manifestation of declining PPU (Paradoxical Permeability of the Universe), yielding testable predictions.  
- **AI**: A quantitative threshold for phenomenal consciousness, expressed as **Propertyness (Nₚ) ≈ 10⁶**.  
- **Mathematics**: Resolution of the Platonism–nominalism debate by treating math as an autonomous ontological domain (W₂).  
- **Interdisciplinarity**: Modeling psychosomatic disorders and historical revolutions as phase transitions governed by systemic tension and Salience (Property 37).

Crucially, MPO-S is not a doctrine to be believed, but a **tool to be used**—enabled by human–AI collaboration, where AI handles formal complexity while the human engages with narratives, diagnostics, and opportunities.

> “Universality of Method, not of Truth.”

The essay concludes that systematic empirical success across disparate fields transforms initial skepticism into methodological trust—not through assertion, but through **demonstration**.
