# The Dialectics of Bindability  
## Power as Mutual Control (Property 34, Ontology Lab)

This concise core note articulates the dialectical essence of **Property 34 (Bindability)** within the Meta-Ontological Property System (MPO-System). It challenges the classical, asymmetric view of power—where an agent unilaterally binds an object—and reveals its hidden feedback structure: **every act of control generates counter-dependence**.

Through analysis of cosmology (black holes), biology (immune systems), cognition (perception), and technology (AI), the text demonstrates a universal pattern:  
> **Implosion** (concentration, control, integration)  
> ⇄  
> **Explosion** (emission, feedback, dependency)

The result is **ontological counterpoint**: the controller becomes bound by the very connection it establishes. Power is not a stick grasped at one end—it is a rod that, once taken, grows into the hand that holds it.

This document serves as a distilled theoretical precursor to the full methodological treatment in **[Interface and Bindability](https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab/blob/main/docs/core/Interface-and-Bindability.pdf)** (DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.18099757](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18099757)).

> “One cannot enter a connection without being changed by it. Any attempt at unidirectional action upon a system results in the system beginning to act upon you.”
