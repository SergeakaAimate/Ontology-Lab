## Core Thesis

This essay reveals a deep **ontological correspondence** between the chaotic dynamics of the physical three-body problem and the semantic unpredictability of the **Ready-Ready Show! (RRS)** word game. Both are manifestations of a universal pattern of complexity governed by the same set of **MPO-System properties**, such as *Chaoticity (16)*, *Dynamics (6)*, *Bindability (34)*, and *Uncertainty (13)*.

The dialogue format traces the live emergence of this insight—from a simple association to a full-fledged **operational model of the intuitive leap**, the asymmetry of truth/falsehood, and the existential risks of meaning collapse.

## Key Contributions

- **RRS as the “N-Body Problem for Linguistics and Theory of Mind”**:  
  After three moves, the game enters a chaotic regime where reconstruction of the original word becomes logically impossible without an intuitive leap.

- **The Intuitive Leap as a Structured Ontological Process**:  
  Formalized as a catastrophic transition from *Propertylessness (25)* to *Onticity (33)*, triggered by *Salience (37)* while processing non-locally bound data under *Paradoxical Stability (PPU→)*.

- **Truth vs. Falsehood as Asymmetrical Ontological States**:  
  Truth is resonance and closure; falsehood is decoherence and a catalyst for new complexity—a generator of understanding, not merely error.

- **The “Semantic Black Hole”**:  
  A catastrophic regime where *Cohesion (KSS)* collapses, *Salience (37)* inverts, and *Reflexivity (9)* turns into infinite self-devouring—a state of ontological barrenness.

- **Existential Ethics of the “Unactualized”**:  
  Drawing on Hesse’s *Steppenwolf* and Venichka’s “Since you were born, you have to live a little!”, the essay defends the ontological priority of potentiality over actuality.
