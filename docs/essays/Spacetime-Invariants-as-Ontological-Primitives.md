# Spacetime Invariants as Ontological Primitives

## Abstract  
This document proposes that the deepest structures of physical reality—spacetime invariants such as proper time, spacetime interval, and light cones—are not merely mathematical conveniences, but **ontological primitives**: irreducible anchors of being that define what can be said to *exist* across all frames of reference.

Where classical ontology begins with objects or substances, and quantum ontology with relations or events, **relativistic ontology begins with invariance**. What persists through transformation is what is real.

## Core Claim  
The Property Method reveals that spacetime invariants satisfy the three criteria of ontological primitives:  
1. **Stability under transformation** (they do not change with observer motion)  
2. **Operational definability** (they can be measured by concrete protocols)  
3. **Generative capacity** (they constrain and enable all possible physical narratives)

Thus, the spacetime interval is not just a number—it is a **property of the world itself**, prior to space, time, or matter.

## Context  
- Part of: [Ontology Lab](https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab)  
- Related to:  
  - `/core/axioms.md` — especially Property 7 (*Invariance under Γ-transformations*)  
  - `/essays/dynamic-realism-and-physics.md`  
  - `/essays/rrs-ontology-of-self.md` (on invariants of identity)

## Key Insight  
> Just as RRS reveals the “original word” as the hidden invariant beneath surface moves,  
> relativity reveals **spacetime interval** as the hidden invariant beneath space and time.

Observer-dependent quantities (length, duration, simultaneity) are *epiphenomenal*—they arise from perspective.  
Only invariants are *ontological*—they constitute the fabric of reality.

## Implications  
- Resolves the “problem of time” in quantum gravity: time is not fundamental; **proper time as worldline invariant** is.  
- Reframes the measurement problem: outcomes are real **only when invariant under relevant symmetry groups**.  
- Unifies physical and cognitive ontology: both are grounded in **what remains stable under transformation**.

## Note  
This work resides in `/essays` because it applies the Property Method to a concrete domain (physics). Its conclusions feed back into `/core` as candidate primitives for a universal ontology. Read it not as a physics paper, but as an **ontological protocol**—a method for distinguishing appearance from being in any relativistic system.
