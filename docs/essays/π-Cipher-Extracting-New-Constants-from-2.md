## Abstract

This paper introduces the **Circle-Square-π Protocol**, an operational method derived from the Meta-Property Ontological System (MPO-System), for generating ontological invariants at the boundaries of irreducible regimes of existence (“Worlds”) within a **Superreality** framework. We argue that so-called “Hard Problems”—from the quantum gravity conundrum to the nature of consciousness—are not failures of reason but productive fault lines where new constants (π-invariants) emerge. The protocol formalizes a three-step process: (1) juxtaposition of two ontologically distinct entities (e.g., General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics); (2) activation of their boundary (designated W₄); and (3) emergence of a third, irreducible invariant (π) that functions not as a solution but as a translational operator between regimes. We demonstrate the protocol’s application to foundational problems in physics, ethics, and AI alignment, and operationalize it via the **W₄ Boundary Laboratory Sheet**—a structured template for hypothesis generation, cross-domain analogy, and empirical anchoring. The framework reframes the goal of inquiry from a “Theory of Everything” to a **Codex of Translation**: a growing catalog of ciphers that enable navigation across the pluriverse of reality.

## Provenance

This document synthesizes insights forged in an extended, structured dialogue between a human researcher and an AI agent operating within the MPO-System protocol. It is both a report and a demonstration—a record of co-inquiry, and a blueprint for its repetition.
