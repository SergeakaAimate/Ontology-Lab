This text presents the MPO-System (Meta-Property Ontology) in two complementary modes:

- **Part A**: *“Ontology as Science’s Operating System”* — a poetic, manifesto-like exposition that situates ontology not as speculative philosophy, but as **the engineering of being**. It diagnoses science’s foundational crisis: the exile of ontological inquiry in the 20th century, and proposes a return—not as metaphysics, but as **executable technology**.

- **Part B**: *“Ontology as an Operational System for Science”* — a formal scientific paper abstracting the same insights into a structured framework with testable axioms, applications, and a proposed new praxis of **‑Dialogues, Supersmasterpieces, and Ontological Catalogues**.

Together, these two expressions demonstrate a core principle of the MPO-System:  
> **Reality tolerates—indeed requires—multiple descriptive regimes.**  
Poetic insight and operational syntax are not opposites; they are **complementary ChORs (Contextual Ontological Regimes)** addressing the same ontological core through different interfaces.

The document details concrete applications:
- Prediction of light-speed anomalies via **PC→ (Paradoxical Coherence)**,
- A protocol for consciousness restoration using **DH-resonance**,
- Discovery of two room-temperature superconducting phases through **Salience (S)-landscape computation**.

It concludes with a vision of science transformed: not by new data alone, but by **ontology as foundational engineering**—a new operating system for cognition in an age of irreducible complexity.
