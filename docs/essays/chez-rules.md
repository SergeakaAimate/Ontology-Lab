# CHEZ: The Great Restoration

A rulebook for a collaborative intellectual game that replaces conflict with co-creation. In CHEZ, players are partners striving not to defeat each other, but to restore harmony through structured play.

## Abstract
CHEZ reimagines the logic of classical games by eliminating capture, check, and victory through domination. Instead, players cooperate within competitive dynamics to fully restore their armies to their original positions. The game introduces core principles—Ying Pai (rigorous structure) and Ruan Pai (adaptive yielding)—as a practical method for achieving ontological balance. Every move becomes a dialogue, every rule a protocol for shared understanding.
