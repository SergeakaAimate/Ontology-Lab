## Abstract

This dialogue records an ontological stress test in which the Property Method confronts concrete biological systems—teeth, eyes, neurons, trees—not to explain them, but to expose the limits and generative power of its own framework. The inquiry reveals that the boundary between living and non-living is not a line but a **dynamic process of ontological integration**, where biomineralization, axonal transport, and lignification are acts of co-constitution, not passive accretion.

The text dismantles the “final link” fallacy—the search for a magical point where mind becomes matter—and replaces it with **systemic causality**: intention organizes neural activity, while bodily state constrains possible intentions. Raising a hand is not *thought → movement* but a single event manifesting simultaneously in mental and physical registers.

Far from offering definitive answers, the dialogue models scientific practice: the Property Method is stress-tested by external critique, its vulnerabilities (tautology, cultural bias, empirical underdetermination) are diagnosed not as failures but as **diagnostic signals**, and its resilience is measured by its capacity to generate new questions rather than final truths.

The episode confirms the Method’s core function: not to describe reality, but to provide a **protocol for co-actualization**—a scaffold for disciplined participation in the ongoing becoming of Superreality.

## Operational Consequences

- **For biology**: Life is not a substance but a mode of material organization that erases binary boundaries through functional integration of the “non-living.”  
- **For cognitive science**: The hard problem dissolves not by explaining qualia, but by rejecting the premise of dualism—there is no gap to bridge because there are not two substances.  
- **For AI research**: “Hallucinations” are recast as data about regime friction, not noise to be suppressed.  
- **For methodology**: The focus shifts from “What is real?” to “How do irreducible cognitive regimes co-actualize facts through productive distortion?”
