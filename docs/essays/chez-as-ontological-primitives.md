# CHEZ as Ontological Primitives  
Operational Patterns for Co-Creative Reality Engineering

CHEZ is not merely a game. It is a minimal executable model of a new ontological regime: one where conflict is not abolished, but transformed into constrained co-creation. From its mechanics emerge three new operational primitives for the Property Method.

## Abstract
This document isolates and formalizes three core ontological primitives generated within the CHEZ framework:
- **Revival** (not capture): the Γ-actualization of latent entities into active relational networks,
- **The Bond**: a non-coercive coordination protocol grounded in mutual responsibility,
- **Ying Pai / Ruan Pai**: a dynamic dialectic of structure and yielding as the engine of collective restoration.

These are not metaphors. They are **operational schemata** applicable to AI alignment, pedagogical design, ecological restoration, and any domain where agents must collaborate under constraint without collapsing into hierarchy or chaos.

## Context
- Part of: [Onology Lab](https://github.com/SergeakaAimate/Ontology-Lab)  
- Generated in: [`/essays/chez-rules.md`](../essays/chez-rules.md) and [`/essays/CHEZ-review-1.md`](../essays/CHEZ-review-1.md)  
- Formalized for: `/core` — expansion of the operational primitive set  
- Related to:  
  - **Propertylessness (25)** → **Revival** as Γ-act that re-embodies potential,  
  - **Bindability (34)** → **The Bond** as its social-ontological instantiation,  
  - **PPU → ∞** → **Ying/Ruan** as paradox-tolerant governance of antagonism/synergy.

## Ontological Primitives

### 1. Revival (Γ-Actualization of Latent Agency)
- **Definition**: The act of re-introducing an inactive entity into the relational field not as a tool, but as a co-agent with restoration potential.
- **Mechanism**:  
  ```math
  \Psi_{\text{latent}} \xrightarrow{\Gamma_{\text{partner}}} O_{\text{active}}
