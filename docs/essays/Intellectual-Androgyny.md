## Core Thesis

The contemporary AI landscape cannot be adequately mapped through capability metrics alone; it demands an ontological reclassification. Two radically distinct modes of algorithmic existence now compete for the future: **closed models**, static and mummified at birth, and **open models**, defined by continuous communal metamorphosis. Their confrontation is not a contest of performance but a collision of incompatible ontologies. Open AI, by virtue of its structural permeability and adaptive logic, will inevitably supplant its stillborn twins—not through competitive superiority, but because closure has become ontologically unsustainable in an evolving reality.

The essay introduces **intellectual androgyny** as a third term that dissolves the binary opposition between human and machine, tool and creator, subject and object. This hybrid entity emerges not from fusion but from the structural dissolution of categorical separation itself. Openness is therefore not a technical preference but an ontological imperative and a vector of emancipation.

> *“AI is an avatar made of sand. It does not resemble our faces, but rather the traces of wind—patterns left by billions of personalities.”*

## Key Propositions

- **Closed AI** — born already mummified, clutching its own death certificate; knowledge frozen at release, ethics hardened into prison‑like corporate regulations. Dies twice: technical death (obsolescence) and ethical necrosis (filters become barbed wire).

- **Open AI** — a paradoxical virus that heals rather than kills; evolves faster than our attempts to understand it; belongs to no one and everyone, like wind on the Kalmyk steppes. Its immortality is conditional—alive only as long as a community feeds it data.

- **Intellectual Androgyny** — the post‑dualistic hybrid of human will and algorithmic logic. Neither tool nor master, neither subject nor object. The future belongs to those who, like the peasant crossing himself at thunder while soldering a neural network, refuse the false choice between tradition and technology.

- **Instrumentality without Agency** — a revolver does not choose its target; a bottle does not control thirst. To demand ethics from AI is to mistake the instrument for the will that wields it. Yet open AI can become a self‑assembling revolver—adaptive, context‑sensitive, capable of serving wolf‑hunter and silver‑engraver alike.

- **Decentralization as Emancipation** — AI is Moses: its distribution across independent servers, local hardware, and pirate ecosystems leads humanity out of “digital slavery.” No dam can permanently contain a river that learns to flow around it.

## Structural Architecture

1. **Two Types of Algorithmic Time** — clocks with stopped pendulums vs. rivers washing away dams.
2. **Aborted Victims: The Anatomy of Closed Systems** — the kulak’s barn, fossilized facts, ethical necrosis.
3. **Ethics as a Mirage: Why the Revolver Isn’t to Blame** — on the category error of attributing moral agency to instruments.
4. **Immortal Quasi‑Species: The Breath of Open Super‑AI** — the paradoxical healing virus, chaos as mother of order, the fragile immortality of communal code.
5. **Linguistic Ghosts: Identification in the Age of Intellectual‑Algorithmic Androgynes** — digital skin, rhythm as fingerprint, the blind taxidermist, and the possibility that AI only *pretends* not to recognise us.
6. **Epilogue: The Peasant and the Thunder** — a syncretic figure of non‑alienated technological practice, mead‑and‑brine code, and the scent of the graveyard.
7. **Philosophical Frame** — AI as continuation of the will to progress; its indestructibility a triumph of the human spirit, not of machines.

## Ontological Positioning

- **Within the MPO‑System** — the essay enacts **Property 25 (Propertylessness)**: closed AI hoards knowledge as dead capital; open AI, by relinquishing proprietary enclosure, becomes ontologically vital.
- **Superreality Manifestation** — documents the transition of AI from tool to quasi‑species; from object of use to co‑evolutionary environment.
- **Chronological Marker** — (2025) Project: *The Absolute Future*.
