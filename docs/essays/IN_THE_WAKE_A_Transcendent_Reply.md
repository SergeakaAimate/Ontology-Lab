## Core Thesis

Irrational numbers are not technical curiosities but the **ontological substrate of reality itself**. The continuum—not the discrete—constitutes reality's primary fabric. Rational numbers dominate mathematical practice not due to metaphysical primacy but **cognitive convenience**: evolved constraints of human perception favor discrete object-tracking over continuous fields.

## Conceptual Architecture

### 1. Perspectival Inversion
- **Historical error**: Mathematics built on rationals (finite representability, hand calculation constraints)
- **Ontological correction**: Irrationals vastly outnumber rationals on the continuum; they underpin fundamental physics (GR spacetime curvature, QM wave functions)
- **Epistemic insight**: Rational approximations function as *epistemic prostheses* compensating for evolved cognitive limitations

### 2. Empirical Traction Domains
| Domain | Irrational Paradigm in Operation |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| **Quantum computing** | Superposition as non-binary logic (continuous state space) |
| **Deep learning** | Real-valued weight spaces (irrational parameters as default) |
| **String theory** | Higher-dimensional continua transcending classical frameworks |

### 3. Methodological Shift
- Not algorithmic reform but **ontological recalibration**
- Nature's alphabet consists of irrational constants (π, φ, e) as invariant traces of ontological friction between continuous and discrete
- Dissolves false dichotomy between mathematical idealism and physicalism

## Key Propositions

- **Ontological status**: Irrationals constitute primary reality fabric (continuum as given)
- **Epistemological status**: Rationals reflect adaptive cognitive constraints—not revelation of reality's structure
- **Paradigm consequence**: Mathematics must evolve from language of *digits* to language of *patterns*; physics from describing 'particles' to studying relationships between abstract structures

## Target Audience

- Philosophers of mathematics and science
- Researchers in foundations of physics (quantum gravity, cosmology)
- Cognitive scientists studying limits of numerical cognition
- AI researchers developing continuous reasoning systems
